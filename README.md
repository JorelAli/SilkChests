This is a Bukkit plugin for Minecraft version 1.8.1, released on [BukkitDev](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/silkchests). This plugin allows you to use silktouch tools on chests which retain their contents. Due to the implementation of shulker boxes, this is now obselete.

### This plugin will not be updated to any future versions of Minecraft. For any inquiries, feel free to contact me personally.
